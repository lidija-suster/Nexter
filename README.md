# Nexter
Nexter is an app for house selling.
Instead of flexbox or floats, responsive design is done via CSS grid, and contains a lot of images that are arranged purely by CSS grid. 
The emphasis here was not on crazy animations or hover effects, but rather on the power of the grid. 
Naming convention is BEM (block-element-modifier), and NPM is used to compile and build the code. 
Full design credits goes to Jonas Schmedtmann ("Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and more" course on Udemy).
